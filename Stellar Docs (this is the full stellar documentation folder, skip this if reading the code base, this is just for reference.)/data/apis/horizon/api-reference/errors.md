# Errors

After processing a request, Horizon returns a success or error response to the client. A success response will return a Status Code of 200, and an error response will return a Status Code in the range of 4XX - 5XX along with additional information about why the request could not complete successfully.

There are two categories of errors: [HTTP Status Codes](/docs/data/apis/horizon/api-reference/errors/http-status-codes.md) and [Result Codes](/docs/data/apis/horizon/api-reference/errors/result-codes.md). Result Codes only follow a Transaction Failed (400) HTTP Status Code.
